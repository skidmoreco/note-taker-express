## Description

This assignment was to use starter code and Express to makw the note taker site function properly. Using app.get, app.use, and app.post I created pathways to allow the user to use the integrated terminal and localhost link to open the note taker site and use it.

## Installation

To access the notetaker, the user must open an intergrated terminal, run npm i and then npm start. The localhost link will appear and when you click it, you will find the note taker home page. When you click the button to the actual note taker, you can create new notes and save them. The site will keep every note stored on the left side column.

## Usage

This is a great use for anyone to store notes. The site lets the user keep the notes on the page so you do not have to worry about losing informaiton when you exit the site.
